    <p>Mint chicken is flavored with finely chopped mint and chicken in this case. Pre-cook the chicken and add the spices, then layer on minced mint to the meat. Mix it well and allow the flavors to infuse for a few minutes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into bite-size pieces</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>½ cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>¼ cup fresh lemon juice</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped fresh mint leaves</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the chicken pieces and garlic. Toss with the flour just to coat, and shake off excess.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Heat the margarine in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces; cook and stir until browned. Add the mint leaves and lemon juice, cover and steam for about 5 minutes, just until the chicken is cooked through. Do not over cook the chicken or it will be tough.
